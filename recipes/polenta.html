        <h4><em>Polenta is nothing more than coarsely ground cornmeal. The classic ratio is 1 part polenta to 4 parts water, but I like to measure the polenta just a little scant of a full cup. I often use chicken broth instead of water. It's a great base for any kind of saucy meat or mushroom ragout.</em>></h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Water: You'll need about four cups of water for every cup of polenta.</li>

            <li>Polenta: Find it in the rice aisle at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>Butter: Three tablespoons of butter adds richness and moisture.</li>
            <li>Cheese: Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese takes this polenta over the top. </li>
